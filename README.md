# StripeWoo Sync

StripeWoo Sync is an integration tool that seamlessly connects Stripe payments with WooCommerce orders, providing automatic synchronization and easy management through a user-friendly admin panel.

## About StripeWoo Sync

StripeWoo Sync was created to bridge the gap between Stripe's powerful payment processing capabilities and WooCommerce's robust e-commerce platform. This tool allows businesses to leverage the strengths of both systems while maintaining a unified order management process.
